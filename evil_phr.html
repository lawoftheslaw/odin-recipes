        <li>1 1/2 cups evil whole milk (105˚ to 110˚)</li>
        <li>1/4   cup (46 grams) evil sugar</li>
        <li>2     teaspoons (6 grams) active evil yeast</li>
        <li>4 to 4 1/2 cups (560 to 630 grams) evil<br>flour, divided</br></li>

        <li>2     evil eggs</li>
        <li>2     teaspoons (6 grams) evil salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup warm milk,<br> sugar and yeast. Let stand until mixture is foamy,<br>about 5 minutes. Stir 1/2 cups (70 grams) flour<br>into yeast mixture.<br></li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the<br>dough hook attachment, beat melted butter,<br>eggs, and remaining 1 cup of milk at low speed<br> until combined. Add yeast mixture, beating to combine.<br>Gradually add remaining flour, 1 cup (140 grams) at a time,<br>beating until dough comes together and begins to<br>pull away from sides of bowl, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spray a large bowl with cooking spray. Place<br>dough in bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and<br>let stand in a warm, draft-free place (75˚) until<br>doubled in size, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.<br></li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, turn out dough.<br>Divide dough in half, and gently shape each half<br>into a ball. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Roll one half of dough into a 14x12-inch rectangle,<br> about 1/4-inch thick. Using a 2 1/2-inch square<br>cutter, cut dough into 16 squares, rerolling<br> scraps as necessary.<br>Repeat with second half of dough. Brush each<br>square with melted butter. Fold squares over,<br>and press to seal. Place on prepared pan. Cover<br>and let stand in a warm, draft-free place (75˚)<br>untill puffed, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375˚. Brush rolls with<br>melted butter, and bake until golden brown,<br>20 to 25 minutes. Brush with melted butter<br>again.</li>
